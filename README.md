__What is this?__

A project to help learn Android app development. Complete with documentation and unit tests (eventually)!


__I want to start coding! What should I implement?__

Have a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/elmundio87/Notepad-Android/issues?state=open) for known bugs and unimplemented features. 

You can assign yourself to an existing open issue, or if you have an interesting idea you can create your own!

Using [Huboard](https://huboard.com/elmundio87/Notepad-Android) you can easily see what everyone else is working on.
